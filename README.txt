This is a collection of linked lists implemented in Java.
They may not be perfect and very likely have some issues.
They are not a complete ADT or API, but a good way to 
play around with implementing various LL data structures
in Java.  Additionally, the approach enables a decent
amount of encapsulation and abstraction.  More 
encapsulation could be applied, but in general these
classes are a good start.

Each directory contains:
-Node class
-LL class (used as the reference to the actual list)
-TestProj (client code)

Complete:
-QueueLL
-StackLL
-DoublyLL

Work in progress:
-DoublyLL
-CircularLL
-OrderedLL
